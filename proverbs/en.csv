Life is available only in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The past is gone, the future is not yet here, and if we do not go back to ourselves in the present moment, we cannot be in touch with life.|Thich Nhat Hanh

If you truly get in touch with a piece of carrot, you get in touch with the soil, the rain, the sunshine. You get in touch with Mother Earth and eating in such a way, you feel in touch with true life, your roots, and that is meditation. If we chew every morsel of our food in that way we become grateful and when you are grateful, you are happy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Enlightenment is always there. Small enlightenment will bring great enlightenment. If you breathe in and are aware that you are alive - that you can touch the miracle of being alive - then that is a kind of enlightenment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Changing is not just changing the things outside of us. First of all we need the right view that transcends all notions including of being and non-being, creator and creature, mind and spirit. That kind of insight is crucial for transformation and healing.|Thich Nhat Hanh
True self is non-self, the awareness that the self is made only of non-self elements. There's no separation between self and other, and everything is interconnected. Once you are aware of that you are no longer caught in the idea that you are a separate entity.|Thich Nhat Hanh

If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. If we really know how to live, what better way to start the day than with a smile? Our smile affirms our awareness and determination to live in peace and joy. The source of a true smile is an awakened mind.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth in the present moment, to appreciate the peace and beauty that are available now.|Thich Nhat Hanh

To think in terms of either pessimism or optimism oversimplifies the truth. The problem is to see reality as it is. A pessimistic attitude can never create the calm and serene smile which blossoms on the lips of Bodhisattvas and all those who obtain the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Reality is reality. It transcends every concept. There is no concept which can adequately describe it, not even the concept of interdependence.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Going vegetarian may be the most effective way to fight global warming. Buddhist practitioners have practiced vegeterianism over the last 2000 years. We are vegetarian with the intention to nourish our compassion towards the animals. Now we also know that we eat vegetarian in order to protect the earth.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Love is the capacity to take care, to protect, to nourish. If you are not capable of generating that kind of energy toward yourself - if you are not capable of taking care of yourself, of nourishing yourself, of protecting yourself - it is very difficult to take care of another person.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You carry Mother Earth within you. She is not outside of you. Mother Earth is not just your environment. In that insight of inter-being, it is possible to have real communication with the Earth, which is the highest form of prayer.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we recognise the virtues, the talent, the beauty of Mother Earth, something is born in us, some kind of connection, love is born.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Breathe in deeply to bring your mind home to your body. Then look at, or think of, the person triggering this emotion: With mindfulness, you can see that she is unhappy, that she is suffering. You can see her wrong perceptions. You can see that she is not beautiful when she says things that are unkind.|Thich Nhat Hanh
There is no way to happiness - happiness is the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In the past there were people who were not rich but contented with their living style, laughing and happy all day. But when the new rich people appear, people look at them and ask, 'why don't I have a life like that too, a beautiful house, car and garden,' and they abandon their values.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The situation the Earth is in today has been created by unmindful production and unmindful consumption. We consume to forget our worries and our anxieties. Tranquilising ourselves with over-consumption is not the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You practice mindfulness, on the one hand, to be calm and peaceful. On the other hand, as you practice mindfulness and live a life of peace, you inspire hope for a future of peace.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We humans have lost the wisdom of genuinely resting and relaxing. We worry too much. We don't allow our bodies to heal, and we don't allow our minds and hearts to heal.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Mindfulness helps you go home to the present. And every time you go there and recognize a condition of happiness that you have, happiness comes.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Compassionate listening is to help the other side suffer less. If we realize that other people are the same people as we are, we are no longer angry at them.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you look at the sun during your walking meditation, the mindfulness of the body helps you to see that the sun is in you; without the sun there is no life at all and suddenly you get in touch with the sun in a different way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In order to heal others, we first need to heal ourselves. And to heal ourselves, we need to know how to deal with ourselves.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you can feel that Mother Earth is in you, and you are Mother Earth, then you are not any longer afraid to die because the earth is not dying. Like a wave appears and disappears and appears again.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Let us fill our hearts with our own compassion - towards ourselves and towards all living beings.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Every thought you produce, anything you say, any action you do, it bears your signature.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you have the insight of non-self, if you have the insight of impermanence, you should make that insight into a concentration that you keep alive throughout the day. Then what you say, what you think, and what you do will then be in the light of that wisdom and you will avoid making mistakes and creating suffering.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We will be more successful in all our endeavors if we can let go of the habit of running all the time, and take little pauses to relax and re-center ourselves. And we'll also have a lot more joy in living.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We fear that this moment will end, that we won't get what we need, that we will lose what we love, or that we will not be safe. Often, our biggest fear is the knowledge that one day our bodies will cease functioning. So even when we are surrounded by all the conditions for happiness, our joy is not complete.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is possible to live happily in the here and the now. So many conditions of happiness are available - more than enough for you to be happy right now. You don't have to run into the future in order to get more.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Listening to and understanding our inner sufferings will resolve most of the problems we encounter.|Thich Nhat Hanh

People suffer because they are caught in their views. As soon as we release those views, we are free and we don't suffer anymore.|Thich Nhat Hanh
To meditate means to go home to yourself. Then you know how to take care of the things that are happening inside you, and you know how to take care of the things that happen around you.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Freedom is not given to us by anyone; we have to cultivate it ourselves. It is a daily practice... No one can prevent you from being aware of each step you take or each breath in and breath out.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Many people are alive but don't touch the miracle of being alive.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Anger is like a storm rising up from the bottom of your consciousness. When you feel it coming, turn your focus to your breath.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Fear, separation, hate and anger come from the wrong view that you and the Earth are two separate entities, the Earth is only the environment. You are in the centre and you want to do something for the Earth in order for you to survive. That is a dualistic way of seeing.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we have peace, then we have a chance to save the planet. But if we are not united in peace, if we do not practice mindful consumption, we cannot save our planet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You are a child of the sun, you come from the sun, and that is something true with the Earth also... your relationship with the Earth is so deep, and the Earth is in you and this is something not very difficult, much less difficult then philosophy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Mother Earth is very talented. She has produced Buddhas, bodhisattvas, great beings.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You know that your happiness and suffering depend on the happiness and suffering of others. That insight helps you not to do wrong things that will bring suffering to yourself and to other people.|Thich Nhat Hanh
With compassion you can die for other people, like the mother who can die for her child. You have the courage to say it because you are not afraid of losing anything, because you know that understanding and love is the foundation of happiness. But if you have fear of losing your status, your position, you will not have the courage to do it.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Buddhism teaches us not to try to run away from suffering. You have to confront suffering. You have to look deeply into the nature of suffering in order to recognize its cause, the making of the suffering.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you learn about the teaching and the practice of another tradition, you always have a chance to understand your own teaching and practice.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Civilisations have been destroyed many times, and this civilisation is no different. It can be destroyed. We can think of time in terms of millions of years and life will resume little by little. The cosmos operates for us very urgently, but geological time is different.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We have to continue to learn. We have to be open. And we have to be ready to release our knowledge in order to come to a higher understanding of reality.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You accept that this civilisation could be abolished and life will begin later on after a few thousand years because that is something that has happened in the history of this planet. When you have peace in yourself and accept, then you are calm enough to do something, but if you are carried by despair there is no hope.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We can continue to learn generation after generation and now is time to begin to learn how to love in a non-discriminatory way because we are intelligent enough, but we are not loving enough as a species.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Most of us experience a life full of wonderful moments and difficult moments. But for many of us, even when we are most joyful, there is fear behind our joy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
There are many levels of Christianity. There are many notions about God. To believe that God is a person is just one of the notions of God that you can find in Christianity. So, we should not say that there is one Christianity. There are many Christianities.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you're a politician, you might want to learn the Buddhist way of negotiation. Restoring communication and bringing back reconciliation is clear and concrete in Buddhism.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child -- our own two eyes. All is a miracle.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The seed of suffering in you may be strong, but don't wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Many people think excitement is happiness.... But when you are excited you are not peaceful. True happiness is based on peace.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
My actions are my only true belongings.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment I know this is the only moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you love someone but rarely make yourself available to him or her, that is not true love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.|Thich Nhat Hanh
For things to reveal themselves to us, we need to be ready to abandon our views about them.|Thich Nhat Hanh
By eating meat we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. The simple act of becoming a vegetarian will make a difference in the health of our planet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Our own life has to be our message.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We are here to awaken from our illusion of separateness.|Thich Nhat Hanh
You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Suffering is not enough. Life is both dreadful and wonderful...How can I smile when I am filled with so much sorrow? It is natural--you need to smile to your sorrow because you are more than your sorrow.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The source of love is deep in us and we can help others realize a lot of happiness. One word, one action, one thought can reduce another person's suffering and bring that person joy.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The mind can go in a thousand directions, but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. With each step, the wind blows. With each step, a flower blooms.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we are mindful, deeply in touch with the present moment, our understanding of what is going on deepens, and we begin to be filled with acceptance, joy, peace and love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you say something really unkind, when you do something in retaliation your anger increases. You make the other person suffer, and he will try hard to say or to do something back to get relief from his suffering. That is how conflict escalates.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Compassion is a verb.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We often think of peace as the absence of war, that if powerful countries would reduce their weapon arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we see our own minds- our own prejudices, fears and ignorance. Even if we transport all the bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of bombs are still there, in our hearts and minds, and sooner or later we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To prepare for war, to give millions of men and women the opportunity to practice killing day and night in their hearts, is to plant millions of seeds of violence, anger, frustration, and fear that will be passed on for generations to come.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you love someone, the greatest gift you can give them is your presence.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Feelings, whether of compassion or irritation, should be welcomed, recognized, and treated on an absolutely equal basis; because both are ourselves. The tangerine I am eating is me. The mustard greens I am planting are me. I plant with all my heart and mind. I clean this teapot with the kind of attention I would have were I giving the baby Buddha or Jesus a bath. Nothing should be treated more carefully than anything else. In mindfulness, compassion, irritation, mustard green plant, and teapot are all sacred.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I have noticed that people are dealing too much with the negative, with what is wrong. ... Why not try the other way, to look into the patient and see positive things, to just touch those things and make them bloom?|Thich Nhat Hanh
Keeping your body healthy is an expression of gratitude to the whole cosmos - the trees, the clouds, everything.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The secret of Buddhism is to remove all ideas, all concepts, in order for the truth to have a chance to penetrate, to reveal itself.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If you suffer and make your loved ones suffer, there is nothing that can justify your desire.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The wave does not need to die to become water. She is already water.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Usually when we hear or read something new, we just compare it to our own ideas. If it is the same, we accept it and say that it is correct. If it is not, we say it is incorrect. In either case, we learn nothing.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is said that God has created man in his own image. But it may be that humankind has created God in the image of humankind.|Thich Nhat Hanh
It is my conviction that there is no way to peace - peace is the way.|Thich Nhat Hanh
My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground on which I stand.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Around us, life bursts with miracles--a glass of water, a ray of sunshine, a leaf, a caterpillar, a flower, laughter, raindrops. If you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere. Each human being is a multiplicity of miracles. Eyes that see thousands of colors, shapes, and forms; ears that hear a bee flying or a thunderclap; a brain that ponders a speck of dust as easily as the entire cosmos; a heart that beats in rhythm with the heartbeat of all beings. When we are tired and feel discouraged by life's daily struggles, we may not notice these miracles, but they are always there.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Root out the violence in your life, and learn to live compassionately and mindfully. Seek peace. When you have peace within, real peace with others is possible.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In true love, you attain freedom.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. This is the most basic kind of peace work.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The most precious gift we can offer anyone is our attention. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.|Thich Nhat Hanh
To dwell in the here and now does not mean you never think about the past or responsibly plan for the future. The idea is simply not to allow yourself to get lost in regrets about the past or worries about the future. If you are firmly grounded in the present moment, the past can be an object of inquiry, the object of your mindfulness and concentration. You can attain many insights by looking into the past. But you are still grounded in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. Every breath we take, every step we take, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When we walk like (we are rushing), we print anxiety and sorrow on the earth. We have to walk in a way that we only print peace and serenity on the earth... Be aware of the contact between your feet and the earth. Walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet.|Thich Nhat Hanh
When you begin to see that your enemy is suffering, that is the beginning of insight.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Until there is peace between religions, there can be no peace in the world.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Breathing in, there is only the present moment. Breathing out, it is a wonderful moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
At any moment, you have a choice, that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it.|Thich Nhat Hanh
A real love letter is made of insight, understanding, and compassion. Otherwise it's not a love letter. A true love letter can produce a transformation in the other person, and therefore in the world. But before it produces a transformation in the other person, it has to produce a transformation within us. Some letters may take the whole of our lifetime to write.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Attachment to views is the greatest impediment to the spiritual path.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Each moment is a chance for us to make peace with the world, to make peace possible for the world, to make happiness possible for the world.|Thich Nhat Hanh
From time to time, to remind ourselves to relax and be peaceful, we may wish to set aside some time for a retreat, a day of mindfulness, when we can walk slowly, smile, drink tea with a friend, enjoy being together as if we are the happiest people on Earth.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In modern society most of us don't want to be in touch with ourselves; we want to be in touch with other things like religion, sports, politics, a book - we want to forget ourselves. Anytime we have leisure, we want to invite something else to enter us, opening ourselves to the television and telling the television to come and colonize us.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Some people live as though they are already dead. There are people moving around us who are consumed by their past, terrified of their future, and stuck in their anger and jealousy. They are not alive; they are just walking corpses.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I am determined to practice deep listening. I am determined to practice loving speech.|Thich Nhat Hanh
The kingdom of God is available to you in the here and the now. But the question is whether you are available to the kingdom. Our practice is to make ourselves ready for the kingdom so that it can manifest in the here and the now. You don't need to die in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. In fact, you have to be truly alive in order to do so.|Thich Nhat Hanh
If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile and blossom like a flower, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Do not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes before suffering. Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world. Find ways to be with those who are suffering by all means, including personal contact and visits, images, sounds. By such means, ...awaken yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world. If we get in touch with the suffering of the world, and are moved by that suffering, we may come forward to help the people who are suffering.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Our notions about happiness entrap us. We forget that they are just ideas. Our idea of happiness can prevent us from actually being happy. We fail to see the opportunity for joy that is right in front of us when we are caught in a belief that happiness should take a particular form.|Thich Nhat Hanh
In mindfulness one is not only restful and happy, but alert and awake. Meditation is not evasion; it is a serene encounter with reality.|Thich Nhat Hanh

Please don't wait until the doctors tell you that you are going to have a baby to begin to take care of it. It is already there. Whatever you are, whatever you do, your baby will get it. Anything you eat, any worries that are on your mind will be for him or her. Can you tell me that you cannot smile? Think of the baby, and smile for him, for her, for the future generations. Please don't tell me that a smile and your sorrow just don't go together. It's your sorrow, but what about your baby? It's not his sorrow, its not her sorrow.|Thich Nhat Hanh
There is no enlightenment outside of daily life.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Being rich is an obstacle to loving. When you are rich, you want to continue to be rich, and so you end up devoting all your time, all your energy, in your daily life to stay rich.|Thich Nhat Hanh
I am inviting you to go deeper, to learn and to practice so that you become someone who has a great capacity for being solid, calm, and without fear, because our society needs people like you who have these qualities, and your children, our children, need people like you, in order to go on, in order to become solid, and calm, and without fear.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We have negative mental habits that come up over and over again. One of the most significant negative habits we should be aware of is that of constantly allowing our mind to run off into the future. Perhaps we got this from our parents. Carried away by our worries, we're unable to live fully and happily in the present. Deep down, we believe we can't really be happy just yet—that we still have a few more boxes to be checked off before we can really enjoy life. We speculate, dream, strategize, and plan for these "conditions of happiness" we want to have in the future; and we continually chase after that future, even while we sleep. We may have fears about the future because we don't know how it's going to turn out, and these worries and anxieties keep us from enjoying being here now.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Guarding knowledge is not a good way to understand. Understanding means to throw away your knowledge.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Being vegetarian here also means that we do not consume dairy and egg products, because they are products of the meat industry. If we stop consuming, they will stop producing. Only collective awakening can create enough determination for action.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Only the present moment contains life.|Thich Nhat Hanh

An oak tree is an oak tree. That is all it has to do. If an oak tree is less than an oak tree, then we are all in trouble.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Your breathing should flow gracefully, like a river, like a watersnake crossing the water, and not like a chain of rugged mountains or the gallop of a horse. To master our breath is to be in control of our bodies and minds. Each time we find ourselves dispersed and find it difficult to gain control of ourselves by different means, the method of watching the breath should always be used.|Thich Nhat Hanh
We who have touched war have a duty to bring the truth about war to those who have not had a direct experience of it. We are the light at the tip of the candle. It is really hot, but it has the power of shining and illuminating. If we practice mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into the nature of war and, with our insight, wake people up so that together we can avoid repeating the same horrors again and again.|Thich Nhat Hanh
Anxiety, the illness of our time, comes primarily from our inability to dwell in the present moment.|Thich Nhat Hanh
